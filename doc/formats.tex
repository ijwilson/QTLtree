The first fomrat that I shall use is based on the GAW data format  - which was the data set used in the 
original 

This is a comma separated table, with rows representting individuals.

The first row of the table gives the SNP names
each subsequent row gives the individual ID and then, comma separated genotypes.


\begin{verbatim}
ID,S1,S2,S3,S4
individualA,A/G,C/T,T/T,C/C
individualB,G/G,C/T,T/T,C/C
individualC,A/G,C/C,C/T,C/C
individualD,G/G,C/C,T/T,C/C
\end{verbatim}
A second file is needed for the positions of the markers, and other information about the markers


\begin{verbatim}

A third file gives the values of the QTLs for each sample, with the first column
comtaining the ID, and the row containing column headers.
\begin{verbatim}
ID,SEX,AGE,SMOKE,Q1,Q2,Q4,AFFECTED
individualA,1,81,0,1.85,-1.58,-0.94,1
individualB,1,67,0,1.69,2.23,-1.29,1
individualC,2,46,0,-0.62,0.13,-0.91,0
individualD,2,62,1,-1.012,0.91,-1.74,1
\end{verbatim}

A further optional targetfile, gives the set of positions to consider.  A natural way to think about this is 
as a list of genes.

\begin{verbatim}
gene,chromosome,position,gene_start,gene_end,gene_length,orientation,geneid
A4GNT,3,139325796,139325756,139333897,8142,-,51146

AATF,17,32381785,32380288,32488284,107997,+,26574
\end{verbatim}


Further data files may be needed such as the ped file, which gives regional information about the sample.

\begin{verbatim}
ID,SEX,AGE,Population
individualA,1,81,pop1
individualB,1,67,pop2
individualC,2,46,pop1
individualD,2,62,pop3
\end{verbatim}
