\title{ Split a set of haplotypes}
\description{
  Splits a set of haplotypes into a tree using a lexical sorting.
}
\usage{
Split(d, cases, SplitPositions, positions)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{d}{ A matrix of haplotypes with samples by row }
  \item{cases}{ A matrix giving the labels of the cases.  By default the
    last half of the sample are cases - note that the algorithm is
    symmetric between cases and controls.}
  \item{SplitPositions}{ The order in which to split the haplotypes }
  \item{positions}{ Positions for the sites given in \code{d} }
}


\value{
A list with the following elements.
  \item{tree }{A tree of class \code{ape:phylo} which can be plotted by the \code{ape} library}
  \item{nodepos}{A vector which gives the ordering of the internal nodes of the tree.}
  \item{ccnode}{Matrix of the number of cases and controls at each internal node of the tree.}
  \item{cctip}{Matrix of the numbers of cases and controls at each leaf}
  \item{n}{Total Number of samples on the tree}
  \item{cases}{Vector of indices of cases}
  \item{labels}{a list whihc gives the indicies of all the samples at each leaf.}
  ...
