Improvements
============

* Integration with fastPHASE and shapeit.  
    * The way to go about this might be to use rehh, either borrowing code or importing the library
* Integration with haplostrips so that I can read vcf files and do the same with that
    * This is proving troublesome as the python dependencies are a little troublesome.  Try to get a docker to work with them
